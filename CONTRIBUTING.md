# Contributing Guidelines

Some basic conventions for contributing to this project.

### General

Please make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned. Likewise, please check for issues related to update, as someone else may be working on the issue in a branch or fork.

* Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first
* New features should ideally be accompanied by tests and documentation
* Develop in a topic branch or fork, not master
* Squash your commits

### Branching

**Branch naming conventions**

* Use grouping tokens (words) at the beginning of your branch names.
* Define and use short lead tokens to differentiate branches in a way that is meaningful to your workflow.
* Use slashes to separate parts of your branch names.
* Do not use bare numbers as leading parts.
* Avoid long descriptive names for long-lived branches.

**Short well-defined tokens**

Choose short tokens so they do not add too much noise to every one of your branch names.

```
wip       Works in progress; stuff we know won't be finished soon
feat      Feature I'm adding or expanding
refactor  Rewriting or improving an existing section of the codebase
bug       Bug fix or experiment
junk      Throwaway branch created to experiment
chore     Upgrade to documentation, formatting, etc
```

### Linting

We have a pre-commit hook that will run our linter, as well as format your code. The code formatting is opinionated,
but allows us to keep the codebase uniform and has the added benefit of allowing any dev to write however they prefer,
and for the codebase to stay standardized.

However, while the linter stays updated with our rulings it is not all powerful, so please be watchful of linting errors
before committing code.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should include a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
 <type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Lines should not exceed 100 characters. This allows the message to be easier to read on github as well as in various git tools and produces a nice, neat commit log ie:

```
 #271 feat(standard): add style config and refactor to match
 #270 fix(config): only override publicPath when served by webpack
 #269 feat(eslint-config-defaults): replace eslint-config-airbnb
 #268 feat(config): allow user to configure webpack stats output
```

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

#### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `webpack`,
`babel`, `loop`, `slide` etc...

#### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end
